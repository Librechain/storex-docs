# Quickstarts

Storex can be used in many different architectures, so we wrote multiple quickstart guides. If you want to see a quickstart for another use case included here, please [submit an issue](https://github.com/WorldBrain/storex-docs/issues/new) or a pull request on GitHub.

If you're developing a new project idea, or are developing a single-user web-based or mobile-based application, check out [how to create a client-side only application](/guides/quickstarts/client-based/) (which you can later change to being server-side with minimal effort).

If you're developing a modern web applcation with a heavy front-end and a cloud-based front-end (think React + AWS/GCP/Heroku), check out [how to create a cloud-based application](/guides/quckstarts/cloud-based/).
