# Multi device sync

Sometimes you want to keep data client-side, but still want to syncronize data between multiple user device to provide a seamless user experience. The `storex-sync` package provides this functionality in a unique, modular and surprisingly easy to understand way. That being said, synchronizing data is a really hard problem, and the default synchronization algorithm might not be for you. As such, you're encouraged to dive and fully understand the source code of this package before integrating it into your own application. For this, you'll need to understand the contents in the [quickstart](/guides/quickstart/), [storage registry](/guides/storage-registry/), [storage operations](/guides/storage-operations), [storage middleware](/guides/storage-middleware/) and [storage modules](/guides/storage-modules/) guides. Ready? Read on for an introduction to `storex-sync` and how to use it in your own application.
