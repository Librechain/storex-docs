- Short intro what Storex Hub does
- What we are going to do
  - Download the boilerplate
  - Start the development version of Storex Hub
  - Write an external application, so you can quickly start and restart it
  - Experiment with some endpoint (exposing a GitHub related call?)
  - Package it as a plugin?
- Starting with the boilerplate and the development Storex Hub:
  - `git clone git@github.com:WorldBrain/storex-hub-boilerplate.git`
  - `git clone git@github.com:WorldBrain/storex-hub.git`
  - In Storex Hub dir, run `DB_PATH=/tmp/storex-dev yarn start`
- The boilerplate automatically registers your external app (link to another page)
- Implementing the remote call
  - https://api.github.com/orgs/WorldBrain
- Packaging it as a plugin
  - The execution model of plugins
  - You build a plugin with Webpack
  - You either place it in the plugin dir next to the Storex Hub binary, or install it with the CLI
- The manifest: `identifer`, `version`, `siteUrl`, `entryFunction`
