- Why would you want to write an external application?
- Starting with the boilerplate and the development Storex Hub:
  - `git clone git@github.com:WorldBrain/storex-hub-boilerplate.git`
  - `git clone git@github.com:WorldBrain/storex-hub.git`
  - In Storex Hub dir, run `DB_PATH=/tmp/storex-dev yarn start`
  - Main entry point for external application in boilerplate is `ts/main.ts`
- Connecting and registering/identifying with Storex Hub (example in `ts/application.ts`, method `registerOrIdentify()`)
  - Note: You need to decide where you store the access key
