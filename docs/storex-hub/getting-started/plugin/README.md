- Why would you want to write a plugin?
  - Integrations that run in the background. Examples: Twitter, IPFS, e-mail, etc.
- The execution model of plugins
  - You build a plugin with Webpack
  - You either place it in the plugin dir next to the Storex Hub binary, or install it with the CLI
- Starting with the boilerplate and the development Storex Hub:
  - `git clone git@github.com:WorldBrain/storex-hub-boilerplate.git`
  - `git clone git@github.com:WorldBrain/storex-hub.git`
  - In Storex Hub dir, run `DB_PATH=/tmp/storex-dev yarn start`
  - To install the plugin, run `yarn cli plugins:install <path-to-build-directory>`
  - Every time you want to reload your plugin, just kill the dev Storex Hub and run the command to start it again
- The manifest: `identifer`, `version`, `siteUrl`, `mainPath`, `entryFunction`
